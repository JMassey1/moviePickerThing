<div class="content">
    <p>September 24th, 2022</p>
    <br>
    <p>Annabelle,</p>
    <p>Although we’ve technically known each other for two years, it wasn’t until this year that I really started to get to know you. We talked a little here and there and played games every now and then, but after the things you went through in February, I wanted to make sure you had someone to help you through it since I knew just how hard it could be. We started watching movies together, playing games (other than valorant) together, and just becoming closer and closer friends. Soon enough, you became my best friend, the person I trusted most, and I truly just enjoyed spending time with you, but it was never anything more than just friends. That’s not to say it wasn’t an extremely meaningful friendship to me and had we just stayed friends, my life would have been 10 times better than it was before I met you. But after months and months of laughing together, getting high or dunk together (love abusing substances), watching movies together, making each other laugh, and just being around you in general, I began to realize just how amazing you really are and just how much happier you made me. I know our relationship didn’t quite start the way you wanted it to, but just like you I want to make sure that everything is perfect and that it really is a special moment for you, because that’s what you deserve. You’re an absolutely amazing person and I’m excited to see where this relationship takes us. 😊</p>
    <br>
    <p>Glad you're in my life,</p>
    <p>Jordan</p>
